# Santander Dev Week - Frontend

Frontend for an web application built using Angular version 12.0.1 at [Santander Dev Week](https://digitalinnovation.one/santander-dev-week-fullstack-developer).

You can run `ng serve` for a local dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and `http://localhost:4200/dashboard`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project is also running in a github page, check it [here](https://caciolucas.github.io/stock-app-santander-frontend/dashboard)

You can also insert some stocks to see the dashboard with more cards [here](https://stock-dio-santander.herokuapp.com/bootcamp/swagger-ui.html).

That's the [backend repository](https://github.com/caciolucas/sotck-app-santander-backend)
